# pptx_ScanText_SaveImages

This script will take any Power Point slideshow and scan all the text for input phrases. It will also save every image into a folder in mere seconds. Great for huge presentations.

A few things are happening here.

First, this will find and place all slideshow text in a list. Then, it will search each paragraph within the list for a word or phrase of your choosing. It will then select only the phrases containing your text and print them on new lines (making sure to show unique output). 

This also locates and saves all images (not graphic frames like charts or tables) into a folder for you to easily resuse and store.

Notes:
Please choose a file on your computer where you can store the images. Copy and paste the entire file name into the image_folder quotations.
You can write anything for the presentation name. That presentation name will be used in the auto-generated image names so ideally keep it short.
